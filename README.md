 ## Introduction
 
 ###  The invasion of Calluna vulgaris (heather) in Tongariro National Park poses a significant ecological threat, 
 ### displacing native flora and disrupting the local ecosystem. The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF)
 ### has implemented an experimental study to assess the effectiveness of various management treatments aimed at reducing heather coverage and promoting the growth of native vegetation. 
 ### This report analyzes the data collected from the experiment to recommend the most effective treatment

## Methods

## Experimental Design:

### Used a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) to control for environmental variation (e.g., soil, climate).

### Four treatments applied to each block:

### C: Control
### H: Herbicide
### B: Beetles
### HB: Herbicide + Beetles

## Model Structure:

### 𝑌_𝑖𝑗 = 𝐸(𝑦𝑖𝑗)+𝑏_𝑖+e_𝑖𝑗, where 𝑏_𝑖 and 𝑒_𝑖𝑗 are random errors, both assumed 𝑁(0,𝜎^2)

## Statistical Analysis:

### One-way ANOVA with blocking to test mean differences in heather coverage among treatments.

### Two-way ANOVA to test for interaction effects between treatment and year on vegetation types (Heather, Native Monocots/Dicots, Exotic Monocots/Dicots).

### Least Significant Difference (LSD) calculated at 0.05 significance level for treatment–year comparisons

## Key Variables Analyzed:

### Heather coverage
### Native Monocots
### Native Dicots
### Exotic Monocots
### Exotic Dicots

## Plots

### Mean Heather Coverage by Treatment Over Time

### Showed the largest decline under HB, followed by B and H; Control unchanged

### Mean Exotic Dicot Coverage by Treatment Over Time

### All treatments increased coverage; HB had the least increase

### Mean Exotic Monocot Coverage by Treatment Over Time

### Increased under all treatments; least change in Control

### Mean Native Monocot Coverage by Treatment Over Time

### Most growth under HB, then H

Mean Native Dicot Coverage by Treatment Over Time

Greatest improvement with B; slight decrease with H
